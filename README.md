# Modern Minimal Login UI

This project is a **frontend exercise** where I created a modern, minimal **login UI** using **HTML** and **CSS**. The design follows a clean and simple aesthetic, with a focus on providing a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
- **Modern UI**: The login form is styled with minimalist UI components.
- **3D Background Animation**: The background features a 3D animation imported from **Spline**, creating a dynamic and visually appealing experience.
- **User Interaction**: Includes user input fields (email and password), remember me checkbox, and navigation links (forgot password and register).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the login UI, with custom animations and responsive media queries.
- **Spline**: A 3D animation embedded in the background to enhance the visual appeal of the site.
